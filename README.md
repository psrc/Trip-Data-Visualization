# Trip-Data-Visualization


This is Puget Sound Regional Council's version of a travel survey trip visualization tool adapted from an R Shiny application built by TransLink in Vancoucer, BC.

As of current version, neither the Google Maps Directions API nor GPS trace points are used in the mapping function -- only trip origin/destination points. Deployment to a shiny server is forthcoming.

*Updated: August 2, 2019*

### TransLink Original Readme

>An app to visualize reported trips made by individuals who participate in trip diary surveys.

>You can find a working version of the app [here](https://moh-salah.shinyapps.io/Trip-Data-Visualization/).

>The structure of the data and the header names have to match the enclosed sample dataset `fake_data.txt`. Trip routes are generated using Google Maps directions API which is accessed through the [googleway](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleway/vignettes/googleway-vignette.html) package. Users should set the variable `my_key` to their own Google API keys. At the time of developing this app (Feb 2018), only the `driving` and `walking` modes were supported by the `googleway` package. The 'walking' mode can take any of the following values: `Walk`, `walking`, or `on foot`. There are no requirements on the naming of the other modes, however, the `driving` mode will be used for any mode that is not `walking`.
